PCCA Verifier (Node.js) is a library for verifying Proof-Carrying Certificatesâ„¢ issued by [PCCA](https://pcca.proof.show). The verification is done by

- Checking if the input certificate is correctly formatted according to [PCCA Certification Practice Statement](https://www.proof.show/pcca/PCCA_CPS.pdf);
- Checking if the input certificate, in particular, carries a DKIM Proof of CSR;
- Checking if the DKIM Proof of CSR can support the issuance of the input certificate according to the tracked DKIM keys of [PCCA Supported Email Services (PSES)](https://www.proof.show/pcca.html#pses).

For what it means by DKIM Proof of CSR, please refer to [PCCA Research Paper](https://www.proof.show/pcca/PCCA.pdf).
